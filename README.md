# Git Sandbox

This repository contains exercises that let you practice what you learned in workshops introducing Git and GitHub.

### You'll need
1. **A Bash shell** (Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple tasks more quickly) ([setup instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup))
2. **The version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/)** (Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code on github.com) ([setup instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git))
3. **A text editor you’re comfortable with** (Notepad, TextEdit, Gedit, nano, emacs, vi, Sublime Text, Atom, VSCode, etc.)
4. **A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account** (Basic GitHub accounts are free, and we encourage you to create a GitHub account if you don’t have one already. Please consider what personal information you’d like to reveal. For example, you may want to review these [instructions for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/))
5. **A modern browser** (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari, or Internet Explorer version 9 or above)
